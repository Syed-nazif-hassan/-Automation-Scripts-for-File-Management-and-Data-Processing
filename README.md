# Automation Scripts for File Management and Data Processing

### This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to automate various tasks, including file management, data processing, and directory traversal. The scripts utilize built-in Python modules and libraries to handle operations such as file reading and writing, directory navigation, and data handling efficiently.

### These automation scripts were developed as part of my job to streamline repetitive tasks and increase productivity by automating common file system operations.
